# 🧪 Playground – Experiments & Tests

This repository serves as a **sandbox** to test, prototype, and validate ideas in programming.  
The goal is to create a space for quick experiments, proofs of concept (POCs), and technology exploration, without the need for a dedicated repository for each small project.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a dedicated space for quick programming experiments.  
- Explore and practice with different languages, frameworks, and libraries.  
- Validate ideas before applying them to larger or production projects.  
- Build a reference collection of small, working examples for future use.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of the experiment you want to explore.  
2. Check if the folder contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions.  
3. Run the code and experiment freely.

## 📝 Notes
- These projects are **experimental** and not intended for production use.  
- Code quality and structure may vary depending on the purpose of each test.  
- Reusable snippets or concepts discovered here can later be refined and applied to real projects.
